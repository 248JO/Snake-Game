# Snake-Game
Multi-player snake game

A modern twist on the classic snake game featuring multiplayer functionality. Players can connect to a shared game server via the same port to view and compete with others in real time. Each player’s snake grows longer as it collects points, but colliding with a wall or barrier results in the snake’s death and a loss of all points. The game also tracks and displays each player’s highest score.

Project Highlights:
Developed a snake game with C#, HTML, and CSS, implementing backend GUI and server components.

Collaborated with a partner to design game logic, real-time interactions, and smooth gameplay.

Strengthened teamwork and software skills by building a functional, interactive multiplayer experience.
